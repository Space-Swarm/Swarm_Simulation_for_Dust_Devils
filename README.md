#Simulating a Swarm for a Space Mission Proposal - Using a Swarm to detect lightning in Dust Devils on Mars

There are the following tools available:

Main programming files to run massive sweeps of simulation with the option of using parallel python to speed up the code (Any file with main in the title in combination with sweep or BP)

An optimisation process for the results using scipy brute force (2. Main_Types_Testing_Optimise_Area_Coverage.ipynb)

A grapher to play back generated data files to visually inspect results of simulations

Robot class to represents the robots Dust Devil class to represent the dust devils Live_Functions* module of functions used in the simulations

A post processing file to analyse data, and create relevant graphics
